            <h2 class="title2">Who are LOOΠΔ?</h2>
            <p>
                Loona (stylized as LOOΠΔ) is a South Korean girl group formed by Blockberry Creative. Its twelve members
                were revealed in a periodic fashion, corresponding to their Korean name Idarui Sonyeo (이달의 소녀), which
                translates to Girl of the Month.

                Loona commenced their pre-debut project in August 2016, with each member releasing a promotional single
                over
                the next eighteen months.The group has formed three sub-units: Loona 1/3, Loona Odd Eye Circle and Loona
                yyxy. Their debut EP as a full ensemble, [+ +] (2018), was supported by the lead single Hi High.

            <h2 class="title2">Why is their Name styled like LOOΠΔ </h2>
            <p>Loona','s English name is derived from the Hangul letters ㅇㄷㅇㅅㄴ, each an initial consonant in the syllabic
                blocks that make 이달의 소녀 (Idarui Sonyeo). When rearranged to ㄴㅇㅇㄷㅅ, it resembles LOONA in the Latin
                alphabet.
